### [Objective](#objective)
Build an app that facilitates rolls of any attribute, skill or damage for any character sheet in GURPS 4e. One that is easy to use and setup.

### [Technologies](#technologies)
* [VueJS 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### [Requirements](#Requirements)
Before starting, you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your machine.
And a code editor, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

### [Running the app](#running)
### â€¢ First, installation
Create a folder for the app's installation. Inside the folder you created, right click and select ``Git bash here``. And then run this command to clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PedroDelaRisso/gurps-character-dashboard.git
```
### Then, running the thing
Open a command terminal on the repository folder, you can do this using VSCode's keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+'``. Run these commands:
```bash

cd client
npm install #to install the packages needed to run and build the app
# Wait for everything to be installed and then run:
npm run serve
```
As for the backend, open a new terminal, as you need both executing at the same time, and run these commands:
```bash
cd client

npm run backend
```

If everything goes fine, you can access the app inside your browser, by navigating to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You may face problems as some browsers deny direct connection to the localhost. If you use any Chromium based browser, as Chrome or Vivaldi, you can paste this in the address bar: ``chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost``. The first option in the list should read as "Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost". Set it to enabled and now you're all set to run this app!
